### Description:
### Intertwined Fates is an interactive website that aims to introduce the world of Teyvat, by giving much more personality and nature to some of the characters of Genshin Impact. Through our X/Tinder crossover website, users will be able to view several posts made by a few Genshin Impact characters in the homepage. Access each of their accounts to learn more about them, such as information about their ages, hometown, hobbies/interests, etc. The website will feature varying images/text that will depict the everyday lives of the characters. Besides these, users will be able to take a personality test, to determine their own Genshin Impact Vision based on their answers! Genshin Impact is more than a game, it contains a very extensive story with a bunch of characters with depth. We want to tell their stories in a way that keeps users hooked.

### Description of JS:
### One of the key uses of JS in our website is our navigation area, as it will receive inputs from the user to determine where should the user be directed would go. Along with other inputs such as the filter tool, which will require the user to choose certain tags, which will then be sent through the filter. The filter in itself is also an integral part of JS, as it will require some uses of functions, and most especially conditional structures to change outputs depending on the inputs. The quiz will also require multiple if statements to function.
